This is a bad attempt at "simulating" light trajectories near a rotating black hole in order to create images. This is a personal project and is made purely for fun. It probably already exists but I don't really care.

We consider here Kerr black holes. The computations are made using adimentional units defined by *c = G = M = 1*. The equations of motion of the ligth are the same as those in [the article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03808).

## What needs to be done
- OPTIMISATION
- Improving the accretion disk. Creating a realistic[-ish] visual and raising the precision.
- Adding the ability to chose the direction of the view and the velocity of the observer [in a user friendly way].
- Taking into account the change in frequency between the observed and emitted light.
- Adding a pdf explaining the maths... probably at the end. I don't want to write my awful notes in LaTeX right now.
